-- DOWN — 0057_perf_rpcs.sql
-- =============================================================================
-- Restores the PRIOR, correct-but-slower bodies of the three RPCs:
--   * get_platform_overview()     -> the 0050 body (13 independent scalar
--       subqueries: 6 subscriber counts + 2 transaction sums + the rest).
--   * get_all_employers_metrics() -> the 0049 body (6 correlated scalar
--       subqueries per employer).
--   * get_entity_metrics_rollup() -> the HARDENED definition (search_path =
--       public, pg_temp), NEVER the vulnerable bare-public one (audit §1b.6).
--       Since 0057 only changed this function's search_path (body identical to
--       0020), the .down re-emits the SAME hardened definition — it does not
--       reintroduce the missing-pg_temp drift.
--
-- All three use CREATE OR REPLACE preserving signature + output shape, so a
-- replay converges and consumers/tests stay green. Idempotent / safe to re-run.
