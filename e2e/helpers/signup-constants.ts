// Shared test-data constants for the subscriber signup walkthrough.
// Extracted from `e2e/helpers/signup.ts` (Cleanup Phase 3, T8) so the fixture
// values are named, documented, and discoverable in one place — and so that a
// future schema/regex tweak (NIN format, OTP length, occupation enum) lands as
// a one-line constant change rather than a grep across the helper body.
//
// CONVENTION
// ==========
// • Every value here is hand-tuned to satisfy a specific client-side validator
//   or DB constraint. Each constant carries a comment naming the source.
// • Only the signup helper imports from this module. Spec files that need
//   bespoke test data continue to inline it — these constants encode the
//   *happy-path* walkthrough only.
// • Keep this file pure data — no Playwright `Page` / `Locator` references,
//   no buffer construction. Buffer factories belong in `signup.ts`.
