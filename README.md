# Universal Pensions Uganda

A digital pension platform making long-term retirement savings simple, accessible, and meaningful for every Ugandan. Licensed and regulated by the Uganda Retirement Benefits Regulatory Authority (URBRA).

**Live:** [uganda-dashboard.vercel.app](https://uganda-dashboard.vercel.app)

> This repo is a **demo / sales-presentation tool** that sales reps walk prospects through — it is NOT a production fintech. Mocked OTP, mocked KYC, hardcoded unit price, and a 24-hour fixed JWT are intentional demo scope (see `CLAUDE.md §10a`).

## Overview

The codebase covers four surfaces:

1. **Public landing page** (`/`) — scrollytelling marketing site that demos 40 years of compounded savings via scroll-linked animation.
2. **Signup / KYC flow** (`/signup/*`) — 9-step subscriber onboarding (phone OTP, NIRA ID OCR, NIRA verify, face match, AML screen, agent fallback).
3. **Role dashboards** (`/dashboard/...`) — 5 of 6 roles built: Subscriber, Agent, Branch, Distributor, and Employer (the Employer role shipped to production 2026-06-03). Admin is deferred (no shell, no RLS policies yet).
4. **Express backend on Render** (`server/index.ts` mounts `api/*.ts`) — 14 routes covering auth, KYC mocks, contact, chat. Singapore region, Node 22, free tier. Database is Supabase (Postgres + RLS + custom HS256 JWT via `jose`).

## Tech stack

- **React 19** (JSX, no TypeScript on the frontend)
- **Vite 6.3.5** dev server + production builder
- **React Router 7** for top-level navigation
- **TanStack Query 5** for server state; **TanStack Virtual 3** for long lists
- **Framer Motion 12** for scroll-linked + entrance animation
- **CSS Modules** (no Tailwind, no component library) — design tokens in `src/index.css`
- **Leaflet 1.9** + **Recharts 3** for the distributor map and charts
- **Express 5** TypeScript handlers in `api/` mounted by `server/index.ts`; hosted on **Render** (Singapore, free tier, Node 22). Frontend hosted on **Vercel** (Vite preset, no functions).
- **Supabase** (Postgres + RLS + PostgREST). 42 migrations under `supabase/migrations/` (`0001`–`0042`).
- **jose** for custom HS256 JWT signing/verification
- **Playwright 1.60** for E2E (browser-driven full-app suite under `e2e/`)
- **Vitest 4** for unit tests
- **ESLint 9** flat config

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Install (legacy-peer-deps is set in .npmrc)
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Copy the env template and fill in the keys
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Required: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
#           SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET,
#           SUPABASE_DB_URL (for the seed script — do NOT run `vercel env pull`,
#           it overwrites this file. See BACKEND.md §2).

# 3. Frontend-only dev (uses mock data if VITE_USE_SUPABASE=false)
npm run dev   # Vite on :5173

# 4. Full local stack — TWO TERMINALS, or use dev:all for one
npm run dev          # terminal A: Vite frontend on :5173
npm run dev:api      # terminal B: Express backend on :3001 (tsx watch server/index.ts)

# OR, single terminal via concurrently:
npm run dev:all      # spawns both servers, colour-prefixed output
```

> **Local dev = two terminals** (`npm run dev` + `npm run dev:api`) or `npm run dev:all`. **Production = Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend).** See `docs/render-operational.md` for the Render runbook.

## npm scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173 (frontend only) |
| `npm run dev:api` | Express backend on http://localhost:3001 (`tsx watch server/index.ts`) |
| `npm run dev:all` | Both servers in one terminal via `concurrently` |
| `npm run build:api` | `tsc -p server/tsconfig.json` — used by Render's build command and CI |
| `npm run build` | Production Vite build |
| `npm run preview` | Serve the built bundle |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint flat-config (0 errors expected) |
| `npm test` | Vitest one-shot |
| `npm run test:watch` | Vitest watch mode |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Coverage report (install `@vitest/coverage-v8` first — not in `package.json` by default) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright full E2E suite |
| `npm run test:e2e:smoke` | Smoke specs only (`e2e/specs/smoke`) |
| `npm run test:e2e:flows` | Flow specs only (`e2e/specs/flows`) |
| `npm run test:e2e:headed` | Headed Playwright run |
| `npm run test:e2e:ui` | Playwright UI mode |
| `npm run seed` | Seed Supabase via `scripts/seed-supabase.mjs` (~30K subscribers, 314 branches, 2K agents) |

Playwright additionally:

```sh
# One-off, fast iteration
npx playwright test path/to/spec.ts --project chromium
```

## Database

Schema lives in `supabase/migrations/*.sql` (42 numbered migrations, `0001`–`0042`). State-machine writes flow through `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs invoked with `supabase.rpc(name, args)`; direct table writes are blocked by RLS. RLS policies read `auth.jwt() ->> 'app_role'` (NOT `'role'`, which is the Postgres `authenticated` role — see CLAUDE.md §5 anti-pattern 7).

Apply migrations with the Supabase CLI:

```sh
supabase db push    # forward apply
supabase db reset   # local-only, drops + reapplies all migrations
```

Seed demo data with `npm run seed`. Phone numbers use the synthetic `+25671XXXXXXX` range; login at the sign-in modal with any 6-digit OTP.

## Deployment

The deployment topology splits along the frontend/backend boundary:

- **Frontend (Vercel)** — Vite preset, no functions. Auto-deploys on push to `main` via the GitHub App. Preview URL per PR. Env vars (all `VITE_*`) live in the Vercel dashboard across Production / Preview / Development scopes. Do NOT run `vercel env pull` — it overwrites `.env.local` and wipes the local-only `SUPABASE_DB_URL` needed by the seed script.
- **Backend (Render)** — Express 5 on Node 22, Singapore region, free tier. Blueprint at `render.yaml`; **manual deploys only** (`autoDeployTrigger: off`). Env vars (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `SENTRY_DSN`) live in the Render dashboard. See `docs/render-operational.md` for the full runbook — manual deploy procedure, log retention, deploy outage window, silent-failure recovery.
- **CI (GitHub Actions)** — `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs lint + Vitest + `npm run build:api` (tsc gate) + Playwright (dual-server). `.github/workflows/keepalive.yml` pings `/healthz` every 14 min to keep the Render free-tier service warm.

Do not push to `main` without explicit approval — production shares the same Supabase project as local dev.
