# /qa — Automated QA harness

End-to-end browser tests (Playwright) plus a Supabase service-role client for verifying DB side-effects after every UI action. Unit tests live under `src/**/__tests__/` and run via `npm test` (vitest); E2E lives under `e2e/` and runs via the scripts below.

**Current coverage:** the suite has grown well past its original ~78-test baseline and runs across desktop + mobile projects. Three layers now exist under `e2e/specs/`:
- **`smoke/`** — every dashboard route × **all 6 roles** (subscriber, agent, branch, distributor, **employer**, **admin**) + landing + a `_health` check. Each route loads, renders its identity element, and shows its primary CTA without crashing.
- **`flows/`** — golden-path UI actions with DB verification, including subscriber-edit-profile, subscriber-signup-to-contribute (full 9-step wizard + DB), subscriber-signin-with-password, **agent-onboard-subscriber (ENABLED — canonical happy path; the AML-hang is resolved, the test asserts the `create_subscriber_from_agent_onboard` RPC + subscriber/balance rows land)**, agent/branch/distributor drill-to-subscriber, branch-create-agent (live insert + cleanup), distributor-apply-settlement, distributor-exports-csv, employer-contribution-run, admin-create-employer, kyc-failure-paths, auth-otp-retry-lockout, settings-change-password, and distributor-create-branch (marked `test.fail` — UI mock, see bug list below).
- **`db/`** — service-role DB-contract specs with no browser: `invariants.spec.ts` (schema/business invariants), `money-idempotency.spec.ts` (no double-credit on retried writes), and `rls-isolation.spec.ts` (cross-tenant RLS isolation).
- **`regression/`** — targeted UI regressions (map-drill, modal-escape, mobile drawer, empty states, subscriber write-failures, settings stubs).

Subscriber smoke route notes (Phase 6D mobile-redesign — three assertions rewritten in place, not added): `/dashboard/activity` now renders ActivityPage (h1 "Activity" / "THIS YEAR" eyebrow / All-Incoming-Outgoing filters) instead of redirecting to all-transactions; `/dashboard/settings` now renders the account hub whose h1 is "Profile" (not "Settings"), with a "Sign out" action; and `/dashboard/save`'s h1 is "Save" (not "top up", which moved to the footer CTA).

## Subcommands

### `/qa smoke`
```sh
npm run test:e2e:smoke
```
Per-role smoke pass. Every page in every role's dashboard navigates without crashing; identity element renders; primary CTA visible. ~45-60s. Covers landing + a `_health` check + all 6 role dashboards: subscriber, agent, branch, distributor, **employer**, and **admin** (one smoke file per role under `e2e/specs/smoke/`).

### `/qa flows`
```sh
npm run test:e2e:flows
```
Golden-path UI flows with DB verification. Each spec under `e2e/specs/flows/` performs a user action, listens for the relevant PATCH/POST 200, then queries Supabase via service-role to confirm the row was written/updated. `afterEach` reverts state for clean reruns.

### `/qa all`
```sh
npm run test:e2e
```
Runs smoke + flows together (~2 min total).

### `/qa fix`
```sh
npx playwright test --last-failed --headed --trace on
```
Re-runs only failed specs headed, with traces. Then I (Claude) inspect:
- `test-results/<spec>/trace.zip` → open with `npx playwright show-trace test-results/<spec>/trace.zip`
- `test-results/<spec>/test-failed-*.png` → use `Read` (multimodal) to see what the browser saw
- `playwright-report/index.html` → full HTML report

### `/qa db-check <id>`
After a flow spec runs, query Supabase via the `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` MCP tool to confirm rows are in the expected state. The flow specs themselves do this; this subcommand is for ad-hoc verification when investigating a UI report.

### `/qa explore <role>` — **NOT YET BUILT**
Roadmap (Phase 3 follow-up): headed Chromium + computer-use MCP to drive the browser exploratorily. Captures observations as Claude clicks. Slow + token-expensive; opt-in only.

### `/qa screenshot-review` — **NOT YET BUILT**
Roadmap: walk `test-results/**/*.png` from the last run and use multimodal `Read` to describe each — surfaces visual issues that selectors don't catch.

## Architecture quick reference

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `playwright.config.ts` | Config + webServer (`npm run dev:all` → Vite :5173 + Express :3001) + reporter |
| `e2e/global-setup.ts` | Mints HS256 JWTs for all 6 roles (subscriber, agent, branch, distributor, employer, admin) into `e2e/.auth/{role}.json` |
| `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` | JWT minter, storageState helpers, `PERSONA_FOR` demo persona map |
| `e2e/fixtures/db.ts` | Supabase service-role client + `rowExists`/`countWhere`/`getRow`/`cleanupSubscriberByPhone` |
| `e2e/fixtures/motion.ts` | `disableAnimations(page)` — kills framer-motion flake |
| `e2e/specs/smoke/` | One file per role (+ landing); every route → load assertion |
| `e2e/specs/flows/` | UI flows with DB verification (template: `subscriber-edit-profile.spec.ts`) |

**Auth strategy:** tests bypass the SignInModal. `global-setup` signs JWTs directly via `jose` (matching `api/_lib/jwt.ts`) and writes `localStorage` entries (`upensions_token`, `upensions_auth`) to a Playwright `storageState` file. Specs opt in via:
```ts
test.use({ storageState: storageStatePathFor('subscriber') });
```

**DB strategy:** specs that mutate data:
1. Snapshot the original row in `beforeEach` (via service-role client).
2. Perform the UI action.
3. Wait for the relevant network response (`page.waitForResponse(...)`).
4. Query the DB to confirm the side-effect.
5. Restore the original row in `afterEach`.

The pattern is documented in `e2e/specs/flows/subscriber-edit-profile.spec.ts` — use that as the template for new flow specs.

---

## Adding a new flow spec

1. **Pick a UI action** — e.g. "agent onboards a new subscriber". Find the relevant button/form.
2. **Find the backend write path** — grep `src/services/` for the function the form calls. Note whether it's an RPC, a direct `.from().insert()`, or `.update()`.
3. **Identify the table(s) touched** — for SECURITY DEFINER RPCs that hit multiple tables, list each one.
4. **Write the spec** using the template:
   ```ts
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
   import { storageStatePathFor } from '../../fixtures/auth';
   import { disableAnimations } from '../../fixtures/motion';
   import { supabaseAdmin, rowExists, cleanupSubscriberByPhone } from '../../fixtures/db';

   test.use({ storageState: storageStatePathFor('agent') });

   test.describe('agent → onboard subscriber (UI + DB)', () => {
     const uniquePhone = `+2567${String(Date.now()).slice(-9)}`;

     test.afterEach(async () => {
       await cleanupSubscriberByPhone(uniquePhone);
     });

     test('onboarding creates subscriber + balance rows', async ({ page }) => {
       await disableAnimations(page);
       const rpcPromise = page.waitForResponse(
         (r) => r.url().includes('/rest/v1/rpc/create_subscriber_from_agent_onboard') && r.status() === 200,
         { timeout: 20_000 },
       );

       await page.goto('/dashboard/onboard');
       // ...fill form, submit...

       await rpcPromise;

       expect(await rowExists('subscribers', { phone: uniquePhone })).toBe(true);
       expect(await rowExists('subscriber_balances', { subscriber_id: /*...*/ })).toBe(true);
     });
   });
   ```
5. **Pick unique test data** — phone numbers via `+2567${Date.now() % 1e9}` avoid collisions across parallel runs.
6. **Always cleanup** — `afterEach` must restore the seed state so reruns are clean.

## Debugging playbook

When a spec fails, do NOT immediately blame the product code. Decision tree:

1. **Is it a real product bug?** Open the failing screenshot (`test-results/<spec>/test-failed-*.png` via `Read`). If the UI is visibly wrong (error boundary, missing element, wrong text), it's likely a bug.
2. **Is the selector stale?** The product renamed a button or changed layout. Look at the trace (`npx playwright show-trace ...`) to see what the spec was waiting for. Update the spec.
3. **Is it a timing/flake?** Re-run with `--retries=2 --workers=1`. If sometimes passes, switch from `waitFor` to `await expect(...).toBeVisible()` with explicit timeouts.
4. **Is the DB drifted?** Specs that depend on seeded data (e.g. agent `a-001` exists, branch `b-kam-015` exists) fail if seed has drifted. Use `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` to verify. Re-seed with `npm run seed` if needed.
5. **Is the dev server up?** `lsof -i :5173` (Vite) and `lsof -i :3001` (Express) — if either died, Playwright restarts both next run via `npm run dev:all`; no action needed.
6. **JWT expired?** Storage states live in `e2e/.auth/{role}.json` and JWTs are 24h. `global-setup` re-mints on every run, so this should never happen — but if it does, `rm -rf e2e/.auth && npm run test:e2e` forces a fresh mint.

## Known product bugs surfaced by this suite

1. **`src/services/entities.js`** (FIXED 2026-05-18) — `mapAgent`/`mapBranch` originally returned `metrics: null`, causing `ViewAgents.jsx` + `ViewBranches.jsx` to crash on `.metrics.totalSubscribers`. Fix: provide `EMPTY_METRICS` zero-shape default at the mapper level.
2. **`src/dashboard/branch/CreateBranch.jsx`** — distributor-side Create Branch panel is purely a UI mock. `handleConfirm()` (line 253) just calls `setSuccess(true)`; it never invokes `useCreateBranch` or `entities.createBranch`. The hook and service both exist and work — they're not wired to the panel. Spec `distributor-create-branch.spec.ts` is marked `test.fail()` until this is wired.
3. ~~**`src/subscriber-dashboard/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`** — hydration bug~~ — FIXED (verified Phase 6D, 2026-05-29). ProfilePage now hydrates name/email/phoneDigits from the `useCurrentSubscriber` query via a `useEffect` (`ProfilePage.jsx:63-74`), so the form no longer renders empty until the user retypes. The hydration-barrier waits in `subscriber-edit-profile.spec.ts` (and the Profile-save regression test) now key off this committed effect rather than working around a defect.
4. ~~**Agent onboard AML step hang**~~ — RESOLVED. `agent-onboard-subscriber.spec.ts` is now an **enabled** flow spec (`test('full wizard creates subscriber + balances via RPC', …)`, no `test.fixme`/`test.skip`): it walks the full agent onboard wizard under the agent storageState, waits on the `create_subscriber_from_agent_onboard` RPC 200, and verifies the `subscribers` + `subscriber_balances` rows land. It is the canonical agent happy-path. (The `test.setTimeout(60_000)` budget absorbs the stacked mocked-KYC latencies — see the spec header for the timing breakdown.)
5. **`/dashboard/commissions/due`** (agent dashboard) — `due` isn't in `VALID_VIEWS` (`src/agent-dashboard/pages/CommissionsPage.jsx:26`). The component redirects unknown views to `/dashboard/commissions`. Spec smoke-tests the redirect.
6. **`/dashboard/reports/contributions`** (subscriber dashboard) — `REPORT_VIEWS` map keys the route segment as `contributions-summary` not `contributions`. The legacy URL `/dashboard/reports/contributions` would 404; the spec hits the corrected slug.

When a NEW bug is found, follow the pattern in the entities.js fix: surface clearly, fix at the source if a one-liner, otherwise mark the spec(s) with `test.fail()` + a comment, and document here.

## Environment requirements

Same as the rest of the repo:
- `.env.local` with `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set.
- `npx playwright install chromium` (one-time, after `npm install`).
- Node 22 LTS (per `.node-version`).

The harness reads `.env.local` via `dotenv` in `playwright.config.ts` and shares it with the two dev servers (`npm run dev:all` starts Vite :5173 and Express :3001 in parallel; Playwright targets `http://localhost:5173`, and the bundle calls the local Express via `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api`).

## Phase roadmap

✅ **Phase 0** — Scaffold (config, fixtures, global-setup, skill skeleton).
✅ **Phase 1** — Smoke specs (44 tests across all 4 dashboards + landing).
✅ **Phase 2** — Flow template spec with DB verification (subscriber-edit-profile).
✅ **Phase 3** — Finalized skill docs (THIS DOCUMENT). Vision augmentation (`/qa explore`, `/qa screenshot-review`) remains as roadmap below.
✅ **Phase 4** — Regression flow specs (signup→contribute, agent onboard, branch create-agent, distributor create-branch) + mobile-chromium project (restricted to viewport-friendly specs).
✅ **Phase 5** — GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) with lint+unit job and gated e2e job, Playwright report artifact upload, concurrency control.

⏳ **Future** — Vision: `/qa explore <role>` (computer-use exploratory pass) and `/qa screenshot-review` (multimodal Read on captured PNGs). Fixing the agent-onboard AML-step hang. Wiring the UI-mock `CreateBranch` panel to `useCreateBranch`. (The `ProfilePage.jsx` hydration fix landed in Phase 6D — see bug-list item #3.)
