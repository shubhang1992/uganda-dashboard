// Support-ticketing seed — Phase 0 of the subscriber ⇄ agent support inbox.
//
// This module owns the FROZEN ticketing contract: the four status / role /
// category / priority enums and the seed-data generator. Everything else in
// the feature (services, hooks, components) imports the enums from here rather
// than inlining string literals, so the vocabulary has exactly one source of
// truth. The enums are contract constants — components MAY import them. The
// seed data itself is mock data and, like the rest of `src/data`, is only ever
// reached through a service.
//
// Like the other `src/data` modules this file is a demo seed: the "backend" is
// an in-memory session store, so there are no real messaging / notification
// integrations here — just internally-consistent sample threads that make the
// four demo personas (the real `s-0001 ⇄ a-001 ⇄ b-bui-001` chain plus a
// couple of Kampala-Central agents) light up across every UI state the inbox
// needs to demonstrate.
//
// Dates are anchored to `MOCK_NOW` (see `mockData.js`) — never `new Date()` —
// so "replied 3 days ago" copy stays demo-stable across a session and lines up
// with the relative dates used everywhere else in the mock store.

  // ── (C) Employer ⇄ platform support (Phase 7) ─────────────────────────────
  // Standalone employees have no servicing agent, so these threads bypass the
  // subscriber↔agent routing entirely: `subscriberId/agentId/branchId` are null
  // and `employerId` carries the owner. The employer raises + replies; the
  // "platform support" side answers as a SYSTEM message (the canned demo reply).
  // Ids use the `tk-emp-` prefix (reset _seq so they read tk-emp-001..003) — they
  // can never collide with an employee id (`empe-NNN`).
  const EMPLOYER_ID = 'emp-001';
  _seq = 0;

  // (C.1) OPEN contributions thread — employer asked, support replied, employer
  // followed up. The employer has support's latest reply un-seen.
